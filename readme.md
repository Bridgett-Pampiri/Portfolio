# Seipati Bridgett Pampiri - Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using pure HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills, education, projects, and contact information in a clean, responsive design.

## Project Description

This portfolio presents my background as a Software Developer and Systems Administrator. It features:

- An About section introducing me and my professional background.  
- A Skills section listing my technical competencies.  
- An Education section with my academic qualifications and a downloadable CV.  
- A Projects section showcasing three main projects with links to their repositories.  
- A Contact section with my email, phone numbers, GitHub profile, and location.

The website uses semantic HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling, including a modern glassmorphism design with a pink-blue-purple gradient theme. It is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
